# return-path is from evilhost. ru, a suspicious Russian-based domain - not from Microsoft
# This shows the sending mail server (185.200.116.52) which is not an official Microsoft mail server.
# we can do an IP WHOIS lookup to check the owner â€” it would likely show a non-corporate host
# The From looks legit at first glance - but "microsoft" uses a zero instead of an "o" (typosquatting).
# The Reply-To is different again, pointing to another non-Microsoft domain.
# This email fails SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, originates from an untrusted IP, and uses deceptive domains and reply paths.
